# Neighborhood-Map Project

This website is a project for the Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree where we have to create a Neighborhood Map at a
certain location with the help of KnockoutJS framework and Google Maps API.
Aside from the Google Maps API, additional information for different locations is pulled using FourSquare API.

## About the website
This website shows the available places around Riverdale NY that uses Google Maps and FourSquare API. If the user clicks on the
marker, a pop out will open with detail information (streetview) about the location. User can also interact with a sidebar with
a list of the locations that can be clicked and also filter the locations to narrow down the search.
